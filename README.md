## Instructions
This is an arcade-style game, similar to the classic Frogger. The player begins on the grass. The goal is to reach the water without being touched by a bug. The bugs move at varying speeds across the road. The player is moved using the left, right, up and down arrow keys. If the player reaches the water, the score is increased by 3. If the player is hit by a bug, the score is reduced by 1 (unless it was already 0).
